# Reference-Genome-Assembly
Guide for creation of reference genomes in Linux with dDocent and the Stacks package.

A reference genome (aka reference assembly) serves as a representative sample of a set of genes for an idealized organism of a species and are typically used as guides for developing new genomes. Their creation often comprises assembly of reference contigs, which are sets of overlapping DNA segments that form a consensus region of DNA.

This guide describes the process of using genetic sequence data to plot reference contig data, generate a fasta file with complete restriction enzyme associated DNA (RAD) fragments, and output the optimal interval of cutoff values to capture maximum diversity and accuracy.
